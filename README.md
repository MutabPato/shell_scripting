A one hour shell scripting refresher

(What is Shell Scripting?)

Shell scripting is writing a series of shell (Bash) commands in a file to automate tasks—like backups, server setups, data processing, etc.

🏗️ STRUCTURE OF A SHELL SCRIPT

Basic skeleton:

`#!/bin/bash  # shebang tells the system this script runs with Bash

# This is a comment

echo "Hello, world!"`

Save as hello.sh, make it executable: chmod +x hello.sh, then run: ./hello.sh
